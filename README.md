This plugin brings a new concept into the game, now you can throw the bomb. All you have to do is find a bomb site, go into it and press right click. The bomb will be thrown with a certain speed and a certain direction and will plant where it lands, no matter if it is no longer in bomb site.

Features:
  If you are in a bomb site the bomb will be throwed and will get planted.
  If you are outside bomb site and you press right click, the bomb will be just dropped.
  If you are not running a bomb map the plugin will be auto paused, so it won't use memory for nothing.
  
Requirements:
  Okapi module.
  An updated server without dproto.
    It may work into your outdated server with dproto, but if it doesn't, I won't help you.
